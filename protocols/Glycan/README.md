# Glycan simulation protocols
These protocols are intended for simulations of single glycans of small
to moderate size, with counter-ions as needed, in water.  The protocols
have been tested on glycans up to a few tens of residues.  However, they
might work well on larger systems.  

Unless you have developed a custom preparation and minimization protocol,
we recommend that you begin with `Prep_and_Minimization` before using
any other protocol.
