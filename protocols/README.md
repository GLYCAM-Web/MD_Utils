# Protocols
This directory contains simulation protocols arranged according to the
system being simulated.  Note that the protocol for one system, for example
a glycan, might differ significantly from the protocol for another, such
as a glycoprotein.  

## How to use the protocols
In general, the protocols are designed to expect a certain well-defined
input.  Given that, only a single script needs to be run.  Each protocol
directory is a self-contained unit as well.  That is, the protocol in the
directory will work without needing other parts of this repository.  This
allows the contents of the protocol directory to be copied over to a run
directory in a remote compute cluster without leaving any confusion as to 
which files were used to run the simulation.  Where protocols contain symbolic 
links, the files they point to must be copied over.  In the repository, we 
use symbolic links to reduce redundancy and overall repository size.  

Each protocol will require some very specific input.  The input generally
corresponds to files generated by default at GLYCAM-Web.  In each protocol
directory, a file called README.md will describe these.  The same file will 
list the name of the script file to be run.
